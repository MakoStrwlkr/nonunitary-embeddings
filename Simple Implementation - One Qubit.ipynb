    "Consider the Hamiltonian $H$ which acts over $n$ qubits. Let $N = 2^n$. WIthout loss of generality, we can assume that $H$ is Hermitian. Indeed, suppose that $H$ was not Hermitian. Then, we would define $\\tilde{H}$ such that:\n",

    "Suppose that we have the decomposition $H = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_j U_j$ over $n$ qubits, where each of the $U_j$'s are unitary. We know that any arbitrary Hamiltonian can be expressed in such a form due to the fact that any element of the standard orthonormal basis can be expressed as a linear combination of such unitary operators (see Appendix for detailed proof).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_k$. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that $\\alpha_j > 0$ for all $j$. Indeed, suppose that there exists some $\\alpha_j < 0$: we can then replace the term $\\alpha_j U_j$ with the term $\\alpha^\\prime_j U^\\prime_j$, where $(\\alpha^\\prime_j, U^\\prime_j) = (-\\alpha_j, - U_j)$.\n",

    "We define the $\\text{Prepare}$ oracle as follows:\n",

    "Notice that when $H$ can be written as a linear combination of $m$ unitary operators with all positive coefficients, then we need a total of $k = \\lceil \\log_2 m\\rceil ancillary qubits to implement the above procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the success probability of emulating $H$ by the above procedure is $\\frac1{s^2}$. This probability depends on the size of the ancilla and decreases exponentially in the number of qubits contained in the ancilla. We can apply the procedure of amplitude amplification (refer Appendix) to increase this probability up to 1. Ideally, if $s=2$, then this fits the procedure of oblivious amplitude amplification. However, since $H$ is not unitary itself, we need to slightly alter the approach of oblivious amplitude amplification that we use here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, define the $m$-dimensional ancillary reflection $R = I_m - 2 P_0$. Next, define the amplitude amplification operator $A = - WRW^\\dagger RW$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the following facts. Firstly, note that $P_0^2 = P_0$ since $P_0$ is a projection operator and that $P_0 \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$. Also note that, by definition, $W$ is a unitary operator. Moreover, recall our assumption that $H$ is Hermitian. Finally, by construction, we have that:\n",
