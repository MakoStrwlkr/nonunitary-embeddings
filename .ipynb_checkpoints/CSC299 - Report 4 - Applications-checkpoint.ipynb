    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we focus on several practical applications of the LCU algorithm, which we have discussed in Reports 1 through 3. While we will not be delving into the exact details of the code to the extent that was seen in the previous reports, we hope that the use of the LCU class, as introduced in Report 3, shall prove to be a helpful abstraction into implementing the following applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional disclaimer, the applications discussed here claim no result for optimality, and there have been multiple algorithms which prove to be more efficient than applying the LCU method. However, with such a wide range of applications, we wish to show proof-of-concept that the LCU algorithm comes with helpful generalizations which can be used to abstract away some of the technicalities involved in defining circuits for certain operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate finding some applications for the LCU method, we first look at some of the properties of this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, note that the success of our functions is guaranteed independent of the initial state when the operator that we are trying to implement is unitary. Otherwise, the success probability is 1 in the best case, but is still dependent on the initial state taken. However, this is not as bad a limitation as it seems like, because many common operations are unitary and this still provides useful insights into their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can essentially view the LCU algorithm as a form of block-encoding an operator within another operator that acts on a greater number of qubits. Thus, by doing so, we can generalize the LCU framework to be generally applicable in any context where post-selection is used to define success of the algorithm. Furthermore, in instances of quantum computing where it is feasible to define an operation of the form $\\tau: \\left|j \\right\\rangle \\to \\left|j \\right\\rangle$ or any other bijective operation on the state space, we can even generalize the post-selection for the LCU where success is defined on measuring some particular state $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\tau ( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle )$.\n",

    "# Application 1: Implementing powers of operators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and problem setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, implementing some Hamiltonian, $H$, for some type of physical systems is not particularly scaleable due to having a large polynomial complexity, or worse. As such, implementing powers of $H$, say $H^k$ where $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$, further worsens this complexity. For instance, suppose that implementing $H$ requires a total of $N$ terms where $N$ is some expression in terms of the input; then, implementing $H^k$ will require $N^k$ terms, which scales exponentially with the power required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, it suffices to consider implementing $H^2$ instead of $H^k$ for some general $k$, since the extension is fairly straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying LCU\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, using the LCU method, we can simply place two of the LCU blocks for $H$ to approximate the effect of $H^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success probability of doing so relies on measuring the ancilla for both LCU blocks in the zero state. For the first LCU block, after going through the amplitude amplification routine, will be approximately $\\left|\\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2$, where $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ was the initial state. Similarly, the success probability for the second LCU block will be $\\left|\\left| H^2 \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the two LCU blocks, we see that the success probability of such an implementation of $H^2$ is $\\left|\\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2 \\cdot \\left|\\left| H^2 \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, with some initial state $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$, the success probability of such an implementation of $H^k$, for any $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ will be $\\prod_{j=1}^k \\left|\\left| H^k \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on reusing ancilla qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "For the general case, we cannot use the ancilla qubits in more than one LCU block in the above implementation. This is because we are unable to deterministically improve the success probability of the LCU method to 1, and so, there remains some non-negligible probability that the ancilla is not in the zero-state as required. Therefore, reusing ancilla qubits in such a generalized implementation introduces certain dependencies of the later LCU blocks on the earlier blocks, which worsens our overall success probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, to implement $H^k$, where $H$ is written as a linear combination of $m$ unitary operations, we shall require $\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$ ancilla qubits for each LCU block, for a total of $k$ LCU blocks. Thus, the total number of ancilla qubits required for such an implementation is in $\\mathcal{O}(k \\log m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, now suppose that $H$ itself is unitary, or is at least 'close' to being unitary in the sense that there exists some unitary $U$ and some small $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $\\left| \\left| H - U \\right| \\right| < \\epsilon$. Then, we are guaranteed success through the oblivious amplitude amplification procedure at the end of each LCU block. This implies that, after measuring, the probability of the ancilla not being in the zero state is very negligible and thus, we can resuse the ancilla qubits repeatedly. Hence, the number of ancilla qubits in such a case is in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the same analysis holds true for the process of amplitude amplification that was mentioned in Report 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing in code\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a qubit mapping for the ancilla used for each LCU block as demonstrated below. The advantage of doing this is so that "

Such an implementation would greatly reduce the number of ancillary qubits involved in the process, and further aid in automatizing this technique.\n",
