    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing refers to using the properties of quantum states to perform computation; popular examples of such properties include superposition, interference and entanglement. It is believed that quantum computing can enable more efficient algorithms for certain problems than can be possible using solely classical methods, and one such supposed application involves the simulation of quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past thirty years, multiple developments have been made in this field which demonstrate that quantum computers can efficiently simulate Hamiltonian dynamics and much of current ongoing work involves improving the performance of these methods and expanding the scope of such simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to have a method that can simulate the effect of running any non-unitary operation $H$, if we know how to write it as a linear combination of unitary (LCU) operations $U_j$ if we already have some mechanisms for implementing each of the $U_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many practical uses of such a technique is as follows. Suppose that we wish to simulate the evolution under some Hamiltonian $H$ for time $t$ within a maximum error of some $\\epsilon > 0$ with the operator $U = e^{-iHt}$. Divide the time $t$ into $r$ equal time-segments of length $t/r$. For each segment, define the operator for time-evolution within that segment as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    U_r = e^{-iHt/r} \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^K \\frac1{j!} (-iHt/r)^j\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we wish to truncate the Taylor series expansion of the exponential at some order $K$ such that the maximum error for each segment is $\\epsilon/r$, which would imply that the maximum result across all the segments is $\\epsilon$. Assuming that $r > \\left|\\left| H \\right|\\right| t$ (where $\\left|\\left| \\cdot \\right|\\right|$ denotes the usual matrix norm), it has been shown by Berry et. al (2014) \\[insert citation\\] that we must have:\n",

    "# Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Hamiltonian $H$ which acts over $n$ qubits. Let $N = 2^n$ denote the dimension of the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $H$ is Hermitian. Indeed, suppose that $H$ was not Hermitian. Then, as shown by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd while solving linear systems of equations (INSERT CITATION), we would simply define $\\tilde{H}$ such that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\tilde{H} &=\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        0 & H^\\dagger \\\\\n",
    "        H & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In this case, $\\tilde{H}$ acts over $2n$ qubits, where the first $n$ qubits are ancillae. Furthermore, as is evident by the construction above, $\\tilde{H}$ is Hermitian, even though $H$ is not. And so, if $H$ is not Hermitian, we would simply proceed with considering $\\tilde{H}$ instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have the decomposition $H = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_j U_j$ over $n$ qubits, where each of the $U_j$'s are unitary. We know that any arbitrary Hamiltonian can be expressed in such a form due to the fact that any element of the standard orthonormal basis can be expressed as a linear combination of such unitary operators (see Appendix for detailed proof).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a convenient notation for normalization factors in later derivations, we define $s = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_k$ to denote the sum of all coefficients in the linear combination of unitaries. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that $\\alpha_j > 0$ for all $j$. Indeed, suppose that there exists some $\\alpha_j < 0$: we can then replace the term $\\alpha_j U_j$ with the term $\\alpha^\\prime_j U^\\prime_j$, where $(\\alpha^\\prime_j, U^\\prime_j) = (-\\alpha_j, - U_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $m$ unitaries in the expansion of $H$, we shall require $\\lceil\\log_2 {m}\\rceil$ qubits in the ancillary register, along with as many qubits as required by $H$ for the state register. We define two oracles: the Prepare oracle shall only act on the ancilla, while the Select operator shall act on both the ancillary and state registers. We use this approach because we want to have $\\mathrm{Prepare}$ assemble a state in the ancilla register that is representative of the coefficients $\\alpha_j$ in the LCU decomposition, and we want $\\mathrm{Select}$ to consequently assemble the LCU on the state register with the help of the ancilla state obtained after applying $\\mathrm{Prepare}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the $\\text{Prepare}$ oracle such that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\text{Prepare}\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle &= \\frac1{\\sqrt{s}} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\sqrt{\\alpha_j} \\left| j \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "We also define the $\\text{Select}$ oracle as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\text{Select}\\left| j \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle &= \\left| j \\right\\rangle U_j \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the operator $W$ using $\\text{Prepare}$ and $\\text{Select}$ as shown below:\n",

    "    W &= (\\text{Prepare}^\\dagger\\otimes I_N) \\text{Select} (\\text{Prepare}\\otimes I_N)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, we see that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    W \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle &= (\\text{Prepare}^\\dagger\\otimes I_N) \\text{Select} (\\text{Prepare}\\otimes I_N) \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= (\\text{Prepare}^\\dagger\\otimes I_N) \\text{Select} \\left( \\frac1{\\sqrt{s}} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\sqrt{\\alpha_j} \\left| j \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right) \\\\\n",

    "    &= \\frac1{s} \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-\\frac1{s^2}} \\left| \\Phi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $\\left| \\Phi \\right\\rangle$ is some state whose ancillary component lies in a subspace orthogonal to $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$. Hence, if $P_0 = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right|\\otimes I_N$ is the projector onto the zero-subspace of the ancillary register, then we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    P_0W\\left| 0\\right\\rangle\\left| \\psi\\right\\rangle &= \\frac1{s} \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "This implies that if we measure the ancillary register after applying the $W$ operator to $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ and we find that the ancillary qubits are all in the 0 state, then we trigger the succesful preparation in the state register, as desired. Hence, the success probability for this algorithm is currently $\\frac1{s_0^2} = \\frac1{s^2} \\left| \\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2$, which we can improve upon as detailed below.\n",

    "## Notes on procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when $H$ can be written as a linear combination of $m$ unitary operators with all positive coefficients, then we need a total of $k = \\lceil \\log_2 m\\rceil$ ancillary qubits to implement the Prepare operator described in the above procedure. This is because we need enough qubits in the ancillary register to define a unique labeling for each unitary in the linear combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the success probability of emulating $H$ by the above procedure is $\\frac1{s_0^2} = \\frac{\\left| \\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2}{s^2}$. This probability depends on the size of the ancilla and decreases exponentially in the number of qubits contained in the ancilla. We can apply the procedure of amplitude amplification (refer Appendix) to increase this probability up to 1. Ideally, if $s=2$, then this fits the procedure of oblivious amplitude amplification. However, since $H$ is not unitary itself, we need to slightly alter the approach of oblivious amplitude amplification that we use here, which is further explained in a later section of this report."

    "# Amplitude amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on generalizing the procedure of oblivious amplitude amplification for the case where $H$ is not a unitary operator itself. This procedure will boost the success probability of the algorithm used, since it aims to increase the probability of measuring the ancilla in the zero-state to as close to 1 as possible, in the best case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise with what is meant by \"best case\", recall that the success probability of the LCU operator, $W$, was shown to be $\\frac1{s_0^2} = \\frac{\\left| \\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2}{s^2}$. The procedure of amplitude amplification detailed below aims to boost the value of $s$ to 1, so in the case that $\\left| \\left| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right| \\right| ^2 = 1$, we have that the success probability is $\\frac1{s_0^2} \\approx 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, define the $k$-dimensional ancillary reflection $R = I_k - 2 P_0$ about the zero-state of the ancillary register. Note that this operation is called a reflection because of the way that it operates with respect to elements in the zero state in the ancillary register. For instance, consider the $\\left|j\\right\\rangle$ for the ancillary register where $j\\neq0$ and define the state $\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle = \\left|j\\right\\rangle \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$. Then, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    R \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle &= (I_k - 2 P_0) \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= I_k \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 P_0 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 0 \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "However, now consider the state $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ for the ancillary register, and consider $\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle = \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$. Then, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    R \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle &= (I_k - 2 P_0) \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= I_k \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 P_0 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= - \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, define the amplitude amplification operator $A = - WRW^\\dagger RW$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the following facts. Firstly, note that $P_0^2 = P_0$ since $P_0$ is a projection operator and that $P_0 \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$. Also note that, by definition, $W$ is a unitary operator. Moreover, recall our assumption that $H$ is Hermitian. Finally, by construction, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    P_0 WP_0 &= \\frac1{s} (\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 0 \\right|\\otimes H)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we shall look at the result of applying a single step for the amplitude amplification procedure. For this derivation, define the angle $\\alpha$ such that $\\frac1{s} = \\sin \\alpha$. We have:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    AW \\left| 0 \\right \\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right \\rangle &= A \\left( \\frac1{s} \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-\\frac1{s^2}} \\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &= A \\left( \\sin\\alpha \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\cos\\alpha \\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &= W R W^\\dagger R \\left( \\sin\\alpha \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\cos\\alpha \\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &= W R W^\\dagger \\left( - \\sin\\alpha \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\cos\\alpha \\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle \\right) \\\\\n",
    "    &= ... \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\sin(3\\alpha) \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\cos(3\\alpha) \\left| \\Phi \\right \\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left(\\frac3{s}-\\frac4{s^3}\\right) \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\left( 4 \\sqrt{\\left( 1-\\frac1{s^2} \\right)^3} - 3 \\sqrt{1-\\frac1{s^2}} \\right) \\left| \\Phi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we observe that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    P_0 A W\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle &= \\left(\\frac3{s}-\\frac4{s^3}\\right) \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for this amplitude amplification step, there may be some angles $\\alpha$, or equivalently, some values of $s$, for which the probability of measuring the ancilla in the zero-state remains unchanged. We can find out what these values of $s$ are by simply equating the probabilities as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\left(\\frac3{s}-\\frac4{s^3}\\right)^2 &= \\frac1{s^2} \\\\\n",
    "    s^4 - 3 s^2 + 2 &= 0\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Since we assumed that $s > 0$, this implies that $s = 1$ or $s = \\sqrt2$. Note that $s=1$ is a trivial solution, as in this case, we do not need to apply the amplitude amplification procedure at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we handle the $s=\\sqrt2$ case by simply adding another qubit to the ancilla register, which stays zero throughout the entire process. This, in effect, is equivalent to manually lowering the initial success probability to some other value so that we may then proceed with amplitude amplification as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying $A$ for a total of $p$ times, we note that the resulting state is as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    A^p W \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle &= \\sin((2p + 1) \\alpha) \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + \\cos((2p + 1) \\alpha) \\left| \\Phi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The proof of this claim is presented in the Appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to get the success probability close to 1, we need a value of $p$ such that $\\sin^2((2p + 1) \\alpha) = 1$ and so, we define:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    p &= \\left \\lfloor \\frac1{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/2}{\\arcsin(1/s)} - 1 \\right) \\right \\rfloor\n",
