    "In this report, we shall focus on generalizing the implementation of the LCU algorithm to beyond the one- and two-qubit ancilla cases. Note that we can simply reuse the amplitude amplification routine from Report 1 and the implementation of the $\\mathrm{Select}$ operator from Report 2, since both of these functions have no inherent restrictions on the size of the ancillae used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the primary emphasis of this report shall be to construct a functional implementation of the $\\mathrm{Prepare}$ operator in Python. We also note the fact that we are not currently concerned about the optimality of such an implementation and, as such, the main intention is to simply have a functional program which passes all our tests. The subject of reaching optimality for a program in a generalized setting is often a difficult endeavour, but we shall, nonetheless, introduce certain altenative implementations and potential improvements in certain scenarios in Report 5."

    "# Implementing Prepare operator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the stage\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, recall the strategy that we used to construct a circuit for the $\\mathrm{Prepare}$ operator for the case where we have only two ancilla qubits. In that case, we constructed a parameterized gate and adjusted the parameters using a variational minimization algorithm. We shall obtain inspiration from that approach and proceed in a similar fashion for the generalized case as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a helper function to outsource preparing the target wavefunction, $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$, since this process remains the same as compared to the case for the two-qubit ancilla. This function, \\_target\\_wfn, is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ state for the ancilla. This is computed in Python by calculating how many terms are provided in the linear combination and, if necessary, extending the list of coefficients by appending zeroes to the end of the list based on the number of qubits in the ancilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generator-based variational optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the required generator which would give us the required circuit if we used an infinite Trotter series expansion. We define the following terms:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    G_1 &= \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right|, \\\\\n",
    "    G_2 &= \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note that, because we want to prepare the state $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ from the $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ state, applying $G_1$ to $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ is what we essentially seek for.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain Hermiticity, we thus define the generator, $G$, as $G = i (G_1 - G_2) = i(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| - \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|)$. The reason for subtracting $G_2$ from $G_1$ instead of adding is to avoid encountering a complex phase in the result, as we shall see later. Note that $G$ has three distinct eigenvalues: 0, +1, and -1. As can be verified easily, the state corresponding to the eigenvalue +1 is $\\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle = \\frac1{\\sqrt2} ( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle )$. Similarly, the state corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is $\\left| \\mathrm{Minus} \\right\\rangle = \\frac1{\\sqrt2} ( \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can see that all states which are orthogonal to $\\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| \\mathrm{Minus} \\right\\rangle$ are eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Thus, we define the null space projector of $G$ as $Q = I - \\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\mathrm{Plus} \\right| - \\left| \\mathrm{Minus} \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\mathrm{Minus} \\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now make the assumption that $\\left\\langle 0 | \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0$. Thus, this implies that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    G^2 &=  i^2 (\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| - \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|) (\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| - \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|)\\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| + \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| \\\\\n",
    "    G^3 &= i (\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| + \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right|) (\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| - \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|)\\\\\n",
    "    &= i(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right| - \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi \\right|) \\\\\n",
    "    &= G\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, we notice that, for any arbitrary $k\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, we have $G^{2k} = G^2$ and $G^{2k + 1} = G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the operation $U = e^{-i \\frac{\\theta}{2} G}$. Using the Taylor series expansion, we can thus express $U$ as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    U &= e^{-i \\frac{\\theta}{2} G} \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) I - i \\sin\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) G + \\left( 1 - \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\right) Q\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Let $S$ denote the 2D-subspace with a basis $b = (\\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle, \\left| \\mathrm{Minus} \\right\\rangle)$. Thus, since $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = \\frac1{\\sqrt2} (\\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle + \\left| \\mathrm{Plus} \\right\\rangle)$, this implies that $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\in S$ and hence, $Q \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    U \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle &= e^{-i \\frac{\\theta}{2} G} \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) I \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - i \\sin\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) G \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\left( 1 - \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\right) Q \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\cos\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle - i \\sin\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want $U \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$, this means that we must set $\\theta = \\pi$. However, this only gives an exact result in the case where $\\left\\langle 0 | \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0$ and we take an infinite Taylor series expansion. Since these assumptions are not particularly realistic, we must tweak the values of the exponents in our finite Taylor series expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ be written as a sum of $k$ Pauli-strings, as follows.\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    G &= \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} c_j P_j\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In this notation, the $c_j$'s are some constants and $P_j$'s are some products of Pauli operations on the ancilla qubits. We now consider the Trotter expansion of $U$ with $s$ steps, which we denote by $\\tilde{U}$, as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\tilde{U} &= \\prod_{r=0}^{s-1} \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2s} c_j P_j} \\\\\n",
    "    &\\approx e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} c_j P_j} \\\\\n",
    "    &= e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2} G}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we are now considering a finite expansion, this results in some difference between the actual desired circuit and the circuit obtained with $\\tilde{U}$. To counter-act this change, we introduce variables $t_{r, j}$ into the exponents, all initialzed to 1 in the first ansatz, as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\tilde{U} &= \\prod_{r=0}^{s-1} \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2s} c_j t_{r, j} P_j}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we aim to change the values of the parameters in this circuit so that the expectation value of the result of applying this circuit to the $\\left|0 \\right\\rangle$ state of the ancilla is close to the target state. We use the fidelity of the expectation value of the circuit with the target state as the objective function in this optimization and aim to maximize it to as close to 1 as is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Tequila objectives are fully differentiable (as explained by Kottmann et al.), all objectives in Tequila support analytic gradients. Further, since our initial guess is a good guess in itself, as it is based on the values expected with an infinite Trotter series expansion, this implies that we can simply use gradient-based optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom errors and warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we cannot guarantee, with a variational algorithm used as a black-box for the optimization process, that we will be able to construct an optimal circuit for every list of coefficients in the linear combination. To address such an issue, we allow the users to optionally specify some threshold fidelity of the expectation value of the resultant wavefunction with the target wavefunction. The threshold is initially set to 0.99, or 99\\%, if the user does not pass in any particular value. If the resulting circuit at the end of the function fails to achieve this fidelity, then we raise a custom warning to the user. We leave it up to the user whether they wish to try and catch the warning in hopes of pursuing alternative implementations, or proceed anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also define a custom error for when the size of the ancilla is too small for the number of unitaries provided in the linear combination. When raised, this prompts the user to input some additional qubits for the ancilla register."
