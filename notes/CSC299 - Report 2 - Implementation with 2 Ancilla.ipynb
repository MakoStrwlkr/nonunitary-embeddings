    "# Goals of this report\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously seen how to create the LCU circuit in the case of having two unitary operations in our linear combination (i.e., where we only need one qubit ancilla). Now, we try to extend this definition of the LCU circuit to the case of having 2 qubits in the ancilla, which will allow for having up to 4 unitary operations in our expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in such a step is the fact that having a simplistic implementation of the select operator of the LCU algorithm will result in difficulty in implementing the prepare operator, and vice versa. For this report, we utilize the simple definition for the select operator (as explained in the previous report), with a trade-off of having a more detailed approach for the prepare operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementing Prepare operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the prepare circuit, we are only concerned about what the $\\left| 00 \\right\\rangle$ state gets mapped to, and we are not concerned about what the other states get mapped to, since we shall only ever apply the operator to the $\\left| 00 \\right\\rangle$ state. The difficulty in such an implementation is that we do not know which circuit would give such a result, and hence, the problem effectively reduces to the general problem of state preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section utilizes techniques that were presented in Tequila's tutorial for state-preparation by Alba Cervera-Lierta (2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference used: [Tequila state preparation tutorial](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila-tutorials/blob/main/StatePreparation_tutorial.ipynb)\n",
