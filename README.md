## General info
The field of quantum computation evolves rapidly on the hardware as well as on the software side. Elevating a known classical problem to be executable on a quantum computer requires to reformulate it in a physically interpretative way, using unitary operations that determine the evolution of the quantum state, and hermitian operators that determine the measurements on the quantum system. Many operations are easy to construct for classical algorithms but their embedding into a unitary operation are often not intuitive. There are however techniques to embed those operations into unitary operations on potentially larger qubit systems, using so-called ancillary qubits. Here, the non-unitary operation is embedded into a unitary operation on a larger system.  The goal of this project is to implement generalized techniques that allow the embedding of non-unitary operations in an automatized way providing a trustworthy access to them for several potential fields of applications.
