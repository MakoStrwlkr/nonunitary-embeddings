    "Quantum computing refers to using the properties of quantum states to perform computation; popular examples of such properties include superposition, interference and entanglement. It is believed that quantum computing can enable more efficient algorithms for certain problems than can be possible using solely classical methods, and one such supposed application involves the simulation of quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past thirty years, multiple developments have been made in this field which demonstrate that quantum computers can efficiently simulate Hamiltonian dynamics and much of current ongoing work involves improving the performance of these methods and expanding the scope of such simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to have a method that can simulate the effect of running any non-unitary operation $H$, if we know how to write it as a sum of unitary operations $U_j$ if we already have some mechanisms for implementing each of the $U_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many practical uses of such a technique is as follows. Suppose that we wish to simulate the evolution under some Hamiltonian $H$ for time $t$ within a maximum error of some $\\epsilon > 0$ with the operator $U = e^{-iHt}$. Divide the time $t$ into $r$ equal time-segments of length $t/r$. For each segment, define the operator for time-evolution within that segment as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the Hamiltonian $H$ which acts over $n$ qubits. Let $N = 2^n$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $H$ is Hermitian. Indeed, suppose that $H$ was not Hermitian. Then, we would define $\\tilde{H}$ such that:\n",

    "        H & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Thus, $\\tilde{H}$ acts over $2n$ qubits, where the first $n$ qubits are ancillae. Furthermore, as is evident by the construction above, $\\tilde{H}$ is Hermitian, even though $H$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have the decomposition $H = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_j U_j$ over $n$ qubits, where each of the $U_j$'s are unitary. We know that any arbitrary Hamiltonian can be expressed in such a form due to the fact that any element of the standard orthonormal basis can be expressed as a linear combination of such unitary operators (see Appendix for detailed proof).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s = \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\alpha_k$. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that $\\alpha_j > 0$ for all $j$. Indeed, suppose that there exists some $\\alpha_j < 0$: we can then replace the term $\\alpha_j U_j$ with the term $\\alpha^\\prime_j U^\\prime_j$, where $(\\alpha^\\prime_j, U^\\prime_j) = (-\\alpha_j, - U_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $m$ unitaries in the expansion of $H$, we shall require $\\lceil\\log_2 {m}\\rceil$ qubits in the ancillary register, along with as many qubits as required by $H$ for the state register. We define two oracles: the Prepare oracle shall only act on the ancilla, while the Select operator shall act on both the ancillary and state registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the $\\text{Prepare}$ oracle such that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "We thus define the operator $W$ as follows:\n",

    "    W &= (\\text{Prepare}^\\dagger\\otimes I_N) \\text{Select} (\\text{Prepare}\\otimes I_N)\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle$ is some state whose ancillary component lies in a subspace orthogonal to $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$. Hence, if $P_0 = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0 \\right|\\otimes I_N$ is the projector onto the zero-subspace of the ancillary register, then we have that:\n",

    "### Notes on procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when $H$ can be written as a linear combination of $m$ unitary operators with all positive coefficients, then we need a total of $k = \\lceil \\log_2 m\\rceil$ ancillary qubits to implement the Prepare operator described in the above procedure. This is because we need enough qubits in the ancillary register to define a unique labeling for each unitary in the linear combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the success probability of emulating $H$ by the above procedure is $\\frac1{s^2}$. This probability depends on the size of the ancilla and decreases exponentially in the number of qubits contained in the ancilla. We can apply the procedure of amplitude amplification (refer Appendix) to increase this probability up to 1. Ideally, if $s=2$, then this fits the procedure of oblivious amplitude amplification. However, since $H$ is not unitary itself, we need to slightly alter the approach of oblivious amplitude amplification that we use here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, define the $k$-dimensional ancillary reflection $R = I_N - 2 P_0$ about the zero-state of the ancillary register. Note that this operation is called a reflection because of the way that it operates with respect to elements in the zero state in the ancillary register. For instance, consider the $\\left|j\\right\\rangle$ for the ancillary register where $j\\neq0$ and define the state $\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle = \\left|j\\right\\rangle \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$. Then, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    R \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle &= (I_k - 2 P_0) \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= I_k \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 P_0 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 0 \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "However, now consider the state $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ for the ancillary register, and consider $\\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle = \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$. Then, we have that:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    R \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle &= (I_k - 2 P_0) \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= I_k \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 P_0 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle - 2 \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= - \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, define the amplitude amplification operator $A = - WRW^\\dagger RW$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the following facts. Firstly, note that $P_0^2 = P_0$ since $P_0$ is a projection operator and that $P_0 \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$. Also note that, by definition, $W$ is a unitary operator. Moreover, recall our assumption that $H$ is Hermitian. Finally, by construction, we have that:\n",
